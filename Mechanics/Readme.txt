Guidelines:
1) The main assembly is in "Roomba" folder. There's different configurations made for all the modes.
2) If there is a rebuild error while opening the assembly, just click on the error causing component (any of the 4 belts) > edit feature > without changing anything
   click on done. If that doesn't work then first open "Switching Mechanism.SLDASM" and keeping it open, open the "Roomba.SLDASM". Everything is fine and well defined
   so not sure why SOLIDWORKS gives this error out of nowhere. If there is rebuild error in any other component, it would be my fault.
3) The vacuum cloth and vacuum nozzle will be connected by a flexible, foldable plastic which I didn't show in the model because flexible bodies feature is not there in
   my version of SOLIDWORKS. 
4) The empty space just behind the vacuum cloth will be used for keeping battries and the space right behind it would be used to place the PCB, arduino and other
   circuits.
